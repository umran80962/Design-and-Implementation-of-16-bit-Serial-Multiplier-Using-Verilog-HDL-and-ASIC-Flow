<h1><b>16-bit Serial Multiplier using Verilog HDL and ASIC Flow</b></h1>

This project implements a 16×16 serial multiplier using the shift-and-add method. The design was written in Verilog, simulated in Vivado, and then taken through ASIC tools (Genus and Innovus) for synthesis and layout. The goal was to build a compact multiplier that trades speed for lower hardware cost.

<h2><b>Abstract</b></h2>

This work presents a 16-bit serial multiplier designed in Verilog HDL. It uses the shift-and-add approach, where one bit is processed per clock cycle. The design was functionally verified in Xilinx Vivado and then synthesized and placed-and-routed using Cadence Genus and Innovus. The final output was a clean GDSII layout ready for fabrication. The focus was area efficiency while keeping correct behavior and stable timing.

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

Multiplication is a core arithmetic function in processors and DSP systems. Serial multipliers offer a compact hardware solution by handling one bit at a time, unlike parallel multipliers that use more hardware for speed. This project develops a 16-bit serial multiplier and walks through RTL, simulation, synthesis, and physical design stages.
// SHIFT-AND-ADD MULTIPLICATION THEORY
// -------------------------------------------------------
// This method performs multiplication by processing
// one bit of the multiplier at a time.
//
// For a 16-bit multiplication:
// - Multiplicand = A (16 bits)
// - Multiplier   = B (16 bits)
// - Final Result = 32-bit product
//
// OPERATION PRINCIPLE
// -------------------------------------------------------
// 1. Check the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of multiplier (B)
// 2. If LSB = 1, add the multiplicand (A) to the partial product
// 3. Shift the multiplicand left by one position (A << 1)
//    -> This aligns it for the next binary weight
// 4. Shift the multiplier right by one position (B >> 1)
//    -> To examine the next bit in the next cycle
// 5. Repeat this for 16 clock cycles
//
// WHY IT WORKS
// -------------------------------------------------------
// Binary multiplication is like decimal multiplication:
//
// Example in decimal:
//   45 × 23 =
//     45 × 3 (units place)
//   + 45 × 2 (tens place)
//
// Same in binary:
//   Each bit of the multiplier represents a power of 2
//   So we add shifted versions of the multiplicand
//
// HARDWARE BEHAVIOR
// -------------------------------------------------------
// - A 4-bit or 5-bit counter runs from 0 to 15
// - Accumulator register stores sum
// - Shifting creates the multiplication alignment
// - Result builds over 16 cycles
//
// ADVANTAGES
// -------------------------------------------------------
// - Low hardware cost
// - Needs fewer adders than parallel multiplier
// - Good for low-power / small chip area design
//
// LIMITATION
// -------------------------------------------------------
// - Slower than parallel multipliers since it takes 16 clock cycles
//
// END RESULT
// -------------------------------------------------------
// After 16 clock cycles, we get a correct 32-bit product output
// representing A × B using the shift-and-add method.


<h2><b>Design Methodology</b></h2>

Steps followed:

- RTL coding and testbench design in Verilog  
- Simulation and waveform check in Vivado  
- Synthesis in Cadence Genus  
- Place-and-route in Cadence Innovus  
- GDSII export for chip fabrication  

<h2><b>Working Principle</b></h2>

The multiplier performs 16-bit × 16-bit multiplication over 16 cycles using the shift-and-add method.

<h3><b>Inputs</b></h3>

- Serial_multin1 → Multiplicand (A)  
- Serial_multin2 → Multiplier (B)  
- clk, rst  

<h3><b>Output</b></h3>

- Serial_multout → 32-bit product  

<h3><b>Operation flow</b></h3>

1. A 4-bit counter increments with each clock pulse to track the current bit of the multiplication.
2. The multiplier (Serial multin2) is right-shifted by the counter value to extract the active bit.
3. If the current bit (LSB) is 1, the multiplicand (Serial multin1) is added to the partial sum.
4. A partial product is generated and left-shifted by the counter value for proper alignment.
5. Each partial product is added to the accumulated sum (Parproduct sum) every clock cycle.
6. After 16 clock cycles, the complete 32-bit product is available at Serial multout.
